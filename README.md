# ðŸš€ Telerehabilitation App
 
Telemedicine is a way to access healthcare appointments with healthcare providers on the internet using your phone or computer. These appointments are usually video calls with online chat messaging through an app or platform. It is not meant to replace clinic visits with a doctor but instead should complement regular healthcare. The objective of this project is to use telemedicine patients to access physical therapy services.
